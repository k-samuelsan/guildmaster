a resource-management fantasy strategy game

Due to some difficulties (read: mistakes) in getting the previous game up, I will be starting from scratch. For now, the plan is to create a simple game that borrows the basic premise of WoW's garrison or follower quests - the player will send adventurers out to defeat monsters, help civilians, and overthrow tyrants. 

As of now, the following features are guaranteed: 
  - Random generation of quests
  - Implementation of class system/skill tree
  - Implementation of various forced rotation features (similar to the Will resource in XCOM2)
  - Permadeath
  - Macro progression
  
Other features that are being looked at:
  - Basebuilding
  - Debilitating effects 
  
This project is a slow work in progress.
